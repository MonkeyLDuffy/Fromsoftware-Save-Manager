I made this when I was like 16 so don't hate on me ok???
If I made this today there wouldn't be so much re-use of code in different places, maybe I'll get round to making it better one day.

To use simply select the game you want and set the save path for it in the profiles menu.
e.g. for ELDEN RING select ER0000.sl2

If you want to import saves you already have simply create a folder with the name for the profile and then create a folder inside of it for each individual save file.

Use of buttons:
- Import Save: Copies the current game save into a new item in the list.
- Load Save: Loads the selected item from the list into the game's save location.
- Replace Save: Overwrites the selected item in the list with the game's current save.
