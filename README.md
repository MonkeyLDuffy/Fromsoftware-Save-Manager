### Notes
I made this when I was like 16 so don't hate on me ok??? 
If I made this today there wouldn't be so much re-use of code in different places, maybe I'll get round to making it better one day.

### Usage
1. Select the game from the dropdown.  
2. Set the save path in the **Profiles** menu.  
   - Example: for *ELDEN RING* select `ER0000.sl2`.  
3. To import existing saves:  
   - Create a folder named after the profile.  
   - Inside it, create subfolders for each individual save file.
